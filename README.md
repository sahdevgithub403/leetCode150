# LeetCode – Top Interview 150 Study Plan

This repository is my implementation and tracking of the **LeetCode Top Interview 150** study plan: 150 original & classic questions covering comprehensive interview topics. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## 🧭 Objective  
- Prepare for coding interviews (software engineering roles) by solving a curated list of critical problems.  
- Strongly improve problem-solving, data-structures & algorithms skills.  
- Build confidence for 3+ months of structured interview prep. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Maintain a record of solutions, notes, key takeaways, and progress.

## 📋 Study Plan Structure  
| Week | Topics | Tasks |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1–2  | Arrays, Hash Maps, Two Pointers | Solve ~10-15 questions, write clean code + commentary |
| 3–4  | Sliding Window, String Manipulation | Focus on pattern detection, substring problems |
| 5–6  | Linked Lists, Stacks & Queues | Practice pointers, list modifications |
| 7–8  | Trees, Tries, Recursion | DFS/BFS, tree construction, trie insertion/search |
| 9–10 | Heaps, Sorting, Searching | Priority queues, binary search variations |
| 11–12| Dynamic Programming, Backtracking | Focus on overlapped subproblems, state representation |
| 13–14| Graphs, Advanced Topics | Graph traversal, union-find, network flows, miscellaneous tricky problems |
| 15   | Review & Mock Interviews | Revisit hard topics, time-boxed practice, give mock interviews |

> Note: Adjust the timeline based on your pace, availability, and comfort level.

## 🧠 My Approach & Best Practices  
- Read problem statement carefully; draw sample cases.  
- Decide on approach: brute-force → optimize → code → test.  
- Write clean, readable code with comments explaining logic.  
- After solving: write key takeaways (e.g., “sliding window with dynamic window size”, “use map + count technique for frequency”).  
- For difficult problems: spend time understanding editorials and alternative solutions.  
- Re-visit earlier problems after 2-3 weeks for spaced repetition.
